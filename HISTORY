        - disabled edit_spike_filter by default
    Jul 19, 2006:
        - [m/besttlag.m] [mlocal/loadctd.m] added code to

IX_4:
    Jan  5, 2007:
        - updated version number
        - merged [mlocal/loadctd.m] from 2 older versions (one with bugs &
          one without support for elapsed time)

        - added Dan Torres' code for interpolating irregular GPS time
          series to [mlocal/loadnav.m]
        - added CTD & NAV file layouts to p structure
        - added [mlocal/mkSADCP.m] for pre-processing UH/CODAS-processed

IX_5:
    Jan 17, 2007:
        - updated version to 5beta
        - wrote [m/geomag.m] to use external program to calculate magnetic
          deviation
        - added support for [geomag.m] to [mlocal/loadnav.m]
        - emailed version to Dan Torres & Bruce Huber for beta testing
    Jan 26, 2007:
        - fixed BUG reported by Dan Torres regarding file-layout parameters
          (defaults were in structure p instead of f) [loadctd.m] [loadnav.m]
    Nov 18, 2007:
        - added 3-beam support to [loadrdi.m] 
    May 23, 2008:
        - improved [loadctd.m] to allow removing bad valued
          (f.ctd_badvals) & generate error if calculated sound
          velocities are complex (can happen with bad CTD spikes)
    Jun  4, 2008:
        - improved [cruise.m] & [htmltable.m] to allow for spaces in the
          cruise ID (they are now replaced by underscores)

        - fixed bug in [begin_processing_step.m] (typo that broke
          'eval-expr' code)
        - changed default of p.interp_ctd_times = 1; in [loadctd.m]
          because this does not affect already regularly spaced ctd time
          series but improves time matching of irregularly spaced ones
    Jun 27, 2008:
        - changed version from 5beta to 5
    Jun 30, 2008:

        - removed m & mlocal subdirs
        - BUG: geomag code in [loadnav.m] required additional "" to
               allow spaces in the path of the IGRF coefficient file
        - removed inappropriate warning from [loadctd.m]

IX_6:
    Jul 17, 2008:
        - changed [default.m] to version IX_6beta
        - BUG: start/end positions were adjusted incorrectly at the end
               of [loadctd.m] when a large time adjustment was required
               (mainly with elapsed time base in case the ADCP was
               started significantly before the CTD); significant
               changes required in [loadnav.m] [loadctd.m] and
               also a small (untested) change in [loadctdprof.m]
    Jul 27, 2008:
        - [loadctdprof.m] [loadnav.m]: nanmean() -> meannan()
    Sep 18, 2008:
        - BUG: p.navdata was not set when f.nav was set to ' ', causing
               [loadctd.m] to bomb. Solution: set p.navdata to 0 in
               [process_cast.m]; some modification in
               [loadctd.m] required as well
    Oct  7, 2008:
        - extensively modified ProcFig. 3 in [geterr.m] to detect

          for specific return values; affected files [default.m]
          [dragmodel.m] [getdpthi.m] [getinv.m]
          [getkzprof.m] [getserial.m] [htmltable.m]
          [htmltable2.m] [loadctd.m] [loadctdprof.m]
          [loadnav.m] [loadrdi.m] [loadsadcp.m]
          [prepinv.m] [process_cast.m] [rditype.m]
          [savearch.m] [saveprot.m]; this bug fix was
